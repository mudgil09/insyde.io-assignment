Overview of the project
The Web-based CAD Viewer is an innovative web application designed to provide users with a
seamless and intuitive platform for visualizing and interacting with 3D models. Supporting both
STL and OBJ file formats, this application caters to the needs of engineers, designers, and
hobbyists who require a reliable tool to view and manipulate 3D models directly in their web
browser. By leveraging modern web technologies, the CAD Viewer ensures a smooth and
responsive user experience, making it an essential tool for anyone working with 3D models.
• Features Provided
This application boasts a range of features that enhance the user experience and provide
comprehensive control over 3D model visualization. Users can easily upload their models through
a simple drag-and-drop interface, allowing for quick and eﬃcient access to their files. The
interactive 3D viewer oﬀers intuitive controls for rotating, zooming, and panning, enabling users to
explore their models from any angle. Additionally, the viewer includes multiple view modes, such
as Normal, Wireframe, and X-Ray, which provide diﬀerent perspectives and insights into the
model's structure. To further enhance usability, the application oﬀers a theme toggle feature,
allowing users to switch between dark and light themes to suit their preferences and reduce eye
strain during extended use. Moreover, users can customize the background and object colors,
adding a personal touch to their viewing experience.
• Technologies Used
The Web-based CAD Viewer is built using a robust stack of modern web technologies. React, a
powerful JavaScript library, is used to construct the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and
responsive experience. Three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library, is employed to render 3D
graphics, providing high-quality visualizations of the models. React Three Fiber, a React renderer
for Three.js, integrates seamlessly with the application, oﬀering a declarative approach to
managing complex 3D scenes. Vite, a modern build tool, is utilized to provide a fast development
environment and optimized build process, ensuring that the application runs smoothly and
eﬃciently.
• How to Getting Started
To get started with the Web-based CAD Viewer, users can clone the repository from GitHub and
install the necessary dependencies. The application can be run locally using the development
server, allowing users to explore its features and capabilities. Detailed instructions are provided to
guide users through the setup process, ensuring a hassle-free experience. Once the application is
running, users can navigate to the specified local URL to access the viewer and begin uploading
and interacting with their 3D models.
